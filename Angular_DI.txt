2. What is Injector ?
ANS: Injector is responsible for creating and injecting services into angular application.
When angular application bootstrapped , it creates two types of injector.
1. Module injector - created for each module in angular app.
2. Elements injector- created for every component.

Angular maintains injector tree hierarchy similar to componenet tree.
If any component expected dependency , first the request will send to attached component's injector. It will resolve if it is registered , otherwise the request 
will forward to parent injector. It will go until module as it is parent of components.
